  <p>Hey I'm Ayyan from Pakistan and a student at LGS JT from the batch of 2026. My journey with computers started back when I was 6 years old I think. I found them fascinating. How they could do almost anything or at least that's what I thought. From phones to desktops. They all blew me away. Steve Jobs was one person I always looked upto. Even though he wasn't some programmer or anything but he still was the pioneer that gave the world some of the biggest innovations in the history of technology. Although I haven't really worked on anything CS related till now (I didn't know I was this much into CS till recently). What follow is a few ventures I have participated in.
